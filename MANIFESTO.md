# AEZOS – AEGIS OF ZEUS DEFENSE
**Technical Manifesto v1.0**  
**February 20, 2026**

### The Divine Mandate

The golden hexagon shield with carbon-fiber wings and the circuit-traced lightning “A” is **not just a logo** — it is our covenant.

**AEZOS** was forged in the fire of the **Pump.fun Build in Public Hackathon** (February 2026, $3M prize pool).  

We are building **in public** — every line of code, every design decision, every Lightning Mark — visible on X and Solana explorers from day one. This is a **public oath**: we will shield the innocent and strike the predators.

### The Problem – The Age of Invisible War

In 2026, scams are no longer “smart contracts gone wrong.”  
They are **conversations**.

AI voice clones, deepfake videos, week-long pig-butchering romance scripts, fake support agents, and emotional manipulation now steal **$17B+ annually** (Chainalysis + FBI Feb 2026 data).

New users and OGs alike paste a single chat and lose everything because **no one can read the evolving scam meta in real time**.

Centralized detectors are too slow, too censored, or already compromised.  
We need something faster than the scammers, more transparent than the victims, and more permanent than their lies.

### The Solution – The Aegis

**AEZOS** is the world’s first **real-time, decentralized, conversation-level scam defense infrastructure** built on Solana.

**Core Promise**  
Paste any conversation (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, X DM, screenshot, voice note).  
In **<3 seconds** you receive a divine verdict backed by:

- Hybrid Intelligence Engine  
- On-chain Lightning Ledger  
- Community governance  

The verdict is not a suggestion — it is a **shield** and a **weapon**.

### Technical Architecture (Designed for Eternal Upgrades)

#### Layer 1 – The Oracle (Hybrid Intelligence Engine)
- **LLM Core**: Grok / Llama-3.1 / fine-tuned models trained on 2025–2026 scam transcripts  
- **Rule Engine**: 200+ hard-coded, community-voted patterns (always on-chain)  
- **On-chain Context**: Instant lookup via Helius RPC  
- **Output**: 0–100 “Divine Safety Score” + highlighted red flags + actionable advice  

**Modularity**: New models, languages, or scam vectors can be added via governance without redeploying the frontend or bot.

#### Layer 2 – Lightning Ledger (Solana Program)
Immutable on-chain registry of confirmed scammers.  
(See `programs/aezos/src/lib.rs`)

#### Layer 3 – The Aegis Clients
- Web dApp (Next.js 15)  
- Telegram Bot (live monitoring)  
- Browser extension  
- Future: Phantom SDK, mobile app, enterprise API

**Security Guarantees**  
- All AI calls are verifiable (prompt + response hashed on-chain)  
- Staked $AEZOS required for disputed marks  
- Rate limits + anti-spam baked in

### $AEZOS Token – The Lifeblood of the Aegis

**Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 (fixed, no inflation)  

**Utility**  
- Stake to vote on Lightning Marks  
- Earn rewards from report fees and premium features  
- Priority real-time protection  
- Governance over oracle rules and treasury

### Roadmap – From Hackathon to Eternity

**Phase 0 – Pump.fun Hackathon MVP (February 20–28, 2026)**  
- Landing page (live)  
- Conversation scanner + OCR  
- Green/Red results with exact logo animations  
- Telegram bot  
- Basic Lightning Ledger + staking  
- Full public build transparency  

**Phase 1 – Post-Hackathon (March 2026)**  
- Browser extension  
- Live group monitoring  
- Public oracle endpoint  

**Phase 2 – The Oracle Network (Q2 2026)**  
- Decentralized node operators  
- Wallet & DEX native integration  

**Phase 3 – Guardian Agents (Q3 2026)**  
- Always-on AI agents in chats  
- Voice-note & deepfake analysis  

Every phase is **upgradable via governance**. Smart contracts use proxy patterns so we never migrate — we simply upgrade.
